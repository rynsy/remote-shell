Assignment: rrsh
Description: A restricted remote shell for CS 485

Limitations:
    Doesn't handle strings enclosed in '"' as one token, so they cannot be
    properly passed as parameters to commands.

    Doesn't handle empty commands from the user (e.g. ""), causes a SEGFAULT.

    Client won't exit if server is closed mid-session.
